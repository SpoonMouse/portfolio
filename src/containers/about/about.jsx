          <p>Hi there! I'm Dom, a self-taught developer with a passion for learning. I've been creating <br /> beautiful and responsive
            web applications since October of 2022.</p>
            <p>I have always had a thing for tech, and everyday I learn something new. I'm incredibly <br />
            self-disciplined, and I'm very adaptive to new situations. I'm a problem solver, a self-starter, <br /> and a professional at Googling.</p>
            <p>My main skills can be seen above, but that's not the limit. When times change, <br /> it's a developer's responsibility to keep up. You can always count on me for that. <br />
              Given the chance, I will go above and beyond to ensure a quality product. <br />
              Whether it's sitting down debugging 40+ hours a week, or building a new wep app from <br />
              ground up. I may not be a crazy know-it-all guy, but I know how to use my resources to get the job done.</p>
