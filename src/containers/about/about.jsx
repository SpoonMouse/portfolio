          <p>Hi there! I'm Dom, a self-taught developer with a passion for learning. I've been creating beautiful and responsive <br />
            web applications since October of 2022. I have always had a thing for tech, and everyday I learn something new. I'm incredibly <br />
            self-disciplined, and I'm very adaptive to new situations. I'm a problem solver, a self-starter, and a professional at Googling. My main skills are shown above, <br /> but if you need somebody to learn something else quickly and efficiently, 
             I'm your guy!</p>
